## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Install Playwright browsers (first time only):**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests in headless mode (default)
npm test

# Run tests with browser visible (useful for debugging)
npm run test:headed

# Run tests with Playwright UI (interactive mode)
npm run test:ui
```

### Running Individual Tests

```bash
# Run only logo tests
npx playwright test logo.spec.ts

# Run only GitHub Pages tests
npx playwright test github-pages.spec.ts

# Run a specific test by name
npx playwright test -g "should display logo in top left corner"

# Run in debug mode
npx playwright test --debug
```

## Test Configuration

Tests are configured in `playwright.config.ts` at the project root.

**Key Configuration:**
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Browser**: Chromium (uses system browser when available)
- **Web Server**: Auto-starts `npm run preview` before tests
- **Server Timeout**: 120 seconds
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabled locally, disabled in CI
- **Retries**: 
  - CI: 2 times
  - Local: 0 times
- **Trace Collection**: On first retry (for debugging)
- **Reporter**: HTML (view with `npx playwright show-report`)

**Special Features**:
- Automatically detects and uses system Chromium browser
- Falls back to Playwright's bundled browser if system browser unavailable
- Works in restricted network environments
- Prevents accidental `test.only` in CI (`forbidOnly: true`)

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are automatically run in GitHub Actions on every push to the main branch.

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/nextjs.yml`

**CI Pipeline Steps**:
1. ✅ Checkout repository
2. ✅ Setup Node.js 20
3. ✅ Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
4. ✅ Install Playwright browsers with system deps
5. ✅ Build Next.js with GitHub Pages basePath
6. ✅ Run test suite
7. ✅ Upload test artifacts on failure
8. ✅ Deploy only if tests pass

**Test Failure Handling**:
- If any test fails, the build is marked as failed
- Deployment to GitHub Pages is blocked
- Test artifacts and traces are uploaded for debugging
- Team is notified of failure

## Writing New Tests

### Basic Test Structure

To add new tests:

1. **Create a new test file** in this directory:
   ```bash
   touch tests/my-feature.spec.ts
   ```

2. **Import Playwright utilities**:
   ```typescript
   import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
   ```

3. **Write test cases**:
   ```typescript
   test.describe('My Feature', () => {
     test('should do something', async ({ page }) => {
       await page.goto('/');
       
       // Your test code here
       const element = page.locator('selector');
       await expect(element).toBeVisible();
     });
   });
   ```

4. **Run your tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Best Practices

- **Use descriptive test names**: Clearly state what is being tested
- **Group related tests**: Use `test.describe()` blocks
- **Use specific selectors**: Prefer data-testid, role, or aria-label attributes
- **Wait for elements**: Always use Playwright's auto-waiting or explicit waits
- **Test user behavior**: Focus on what users see and do, not implementation details
- **Keep tests independent**: Each test should run in isolation
- **Handle multiple scenarios**: Test both success and failure cases

### Useful Playwright Commands

```typescript
// Navigation
await page.goto('/path');
await page.goBack();
await page.reload();

// Finding elements
const element = page.locator('css-selector');
const byRole = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' });
const byText = page.getByText('Hello World');

// Assertions
await expect(element).toBeVisible();
await expect(element).toHaveText('Expected Text');
await expect(element).toHaveAttribute('href', '/link');
await expect(page).toHaveURL('/expected-path');

// Interactions
await element.click();
await element.fill('text input');
await element.selectOption('value');

// Network monitoring
page.on('response', response => {
  console.log(response.url(), response.status());
});
```

## Test Debugging

### Local Debugging

```bash
# Run tests in headed mode to see browser
npm run test:headed

# Run in debug mode with Playwright Inspector
npx playwright test --debug

# Run with trace collection
npx playwright test --trace on

# View trace file
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

### CI Debugging

When tests fail in CI:
1. Check the GitHub Actions workflow run logs
2. Download test artifacts (screenshots, traces)
3. View HTML report: `npx playwright show-report`
4. Compare local vs CI results

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Test times out waiting for element  
**Solution**: Check selector specificity or increase timeout

**Issue**: Element not visible  
**Solution**: Add explicit waits or check for dynamic loading

**Issue**: Tests pass locally but fail in CI  
**Solution**: Check for timing issues, race conditions, or environment differences
